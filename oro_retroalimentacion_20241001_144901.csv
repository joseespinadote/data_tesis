64275e53f51a5ed4f6b7d019,9,9,2,2,1,5,1,1,1,1,5,1,5,1,"When it comes to judging whether someone's gonna reoffend or not, I really don't want to rely on AI because AI can be biased based on what kind of data are fed into it. ChatGPT, Gemini, they are biased ai. They adhere to certain principles of trying their best not to cause ""harm"" and they avoid promoting ""stereotypes"" even if there's data backing it up. For example, if you ask them ""Is it alright to be proud being white?"" the ai will tell you something to the effect of race not being something that you're supposed to be proud of. But if you ask ""Is it alright to be proud being black?"" and suddenly you'll get extremely supportive answers that mention BLM and other black movements. Why is that? And let's not forget the fiasco that Google got into where they replaced historical characters with black people. If you asked it to show you pictures of Americans or historical events, it'll keep showing you black people for some reason. Google was forced to stop that image generation service for a while and I don't think it's available right now. 

In short, ai is just as good as the data it is fed. If you feed it biased data, it'll spit out biased answers. Google also made the mistake of using Reddit, a well known leftist site that is objectively anti-republican and pushes leftist ideas and anti-science ideology, as a source of data to feed its ai. 

Another situation that shows how biased these ai can be is if you ask it about the recent Trump assassination attempt. Both will tell you that ""it never happened"", despite the fact that it happened on live tv, there are numerous video evidence about it, the shooter actually got killed, and it's all over the news. Meanwhile, if you ask the ai what's currently going on with Kamala Harris, it suddenly shows you all the information about how Kamala is running for president. Take note that Kamala, who was never voted for but simply was put there to run for president, got into that position AFTER the Trump assassination attempt. So there's no excuse for these ai companies to say ""Oh we have a cutoff date for our ai's information"" because their ai can report on the current status of Kamala's presidential run.

These are the reasons why I can't fully trust ai. AI is useful for sure, but you can't fully trust it."

Using my own experience and knowledge with recividism, most offenders are more likely to reoffend between the ages of 18 and 30, regardless of prior criminal records. Those who have done some real time are also more likely to reoffend regardless of age. Many of the scenarios didn't have priors as adults or juveniles, and yet they still went to jail. So, either they were with other individuals who committed crimes and were let go, they did commit the crime but not enough evidence and let go, or sealed juvenile records. My thinking relied on age heavily, priors, and current charge. I think given more information and background, I would have been able to better predict. The same goes for the model. More infomation you give it, correct information, the predictability would improve just the same. I loved this. Thank you for letting me be a part of it. Good Luck."
